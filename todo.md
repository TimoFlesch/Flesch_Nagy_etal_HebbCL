### todo list 
1. collect individual runs 
2. sluggishness: implement as EMA
3. analysis notebook
    - import runs, create alldata dict 
    - tbc

### analysis notebook: model performance and rsa
- notebook with analysis scripts to replicate cosyne poster
- simulation 1: vanilla blocked vs interleaved
- simulation 2: gated blocked 
- simulation 3: only GHA/SLA
- simulation 4: SLA network blocked
- simulation 5: sluggish sla interleaved: show choices/accuracy for different levels of sluggishness
- simulation 6: sluggish sla on human choices 

### analysis notebook: evaluate model fits
    - plot model predictions (average over cross-validated participants) alongside participant data
    - accuracy
    - sigmoids (rel/irrel)
    - choice matrices
    - rsa on human data and model's choices
    - choice model on human data and model's choices
